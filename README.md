Tester for CMPE150 of Fall 2020, P1

## Requisites
We need to install a library called Markovify, generating Markov Chains for sentence generation, 

Open PyCharm, then install the library:

```
pip3 install markovify
```
Notes:

- You have to download entire repository for the tester, not just download the test_my_code.py
- After the installation you can simply follow the steps in file test_my_code.py and run the tests.
- But if you wish to test your code manually, there are generated cases in file navi-desvita.txt. The 
lines in file are seperated with tabs so you can accept the format as following: 
```
<INPUT>\t<EXPECTED_OUTPUT>\t<EXPECTED_SCORE>
```
- The cases generated are expected cases. No edge cases such as containing "Am&azing!2" or "don''t'".
- For any problems or help you need, you can create an issue in here.
- This code is property of CMPE150. But DO NOT COPY ANY CODE.It will be captured by TeachingCodes, and the lecturer will not tolerate any copying we assume.
